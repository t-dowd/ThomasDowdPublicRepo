How did you structure your Player?
    I had a linked list of players with each value needed.
How did you structure your Game?
    I implemented the structure to resemble the following:
	One time print:
		linked list creation and validation.
	checks if any player has 0 points.
	Iterates through linked list and respond accordingly.
		
How did you make use of classes and functions? What went where?

	Yes I did through useage of functions and classes. Node, LinkedList are my two classes that I created. A few custom created functions that regulate the state of the game include:
		-gameframe // Prints Current Game Board and other such things.
		-nextup    // Evaluates conditions such as reverse and skip and retuns a value of the current player
